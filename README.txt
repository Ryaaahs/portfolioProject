# Personal Website
Personal Website is a web page to showcase my projects and artworks to everyone

## Challenges 
I struggled with image manipulation on DOM load and dynamic re-scaling on different screen sizes and browser windows. 

## What I learned
Learned about responsive web design (phone -> computer or computer -> phone), image manipulation with JS. 

## Usage
Bring in the project folder to your choice of IDE / Text editor, then use your choice of launching a local host. 
For the project I used [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
